## Old Career on Upwork

I had a freelancer profile on [Upwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwork) from early 2009 until 2024.
Upwork Inc., formerly Elance-oDesk, is an American freelancing platform headquartered in Santa Clara and San Francisco, California.
Total client payments to me were about 140k USA dollars.
In 2024 I deleted my Upwork profile since I no longer agree with their marketplace practices.
The next image is a screen shot of some statistics from my old freelancer profile
